## Iris Flower Classification using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates the use of deep learning for Iris flower classification. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, preprocessed, and split into training and testing sets. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is then constructed and trained to classify Iris flowers into different species.
